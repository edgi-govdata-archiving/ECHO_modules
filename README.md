# ECHO_modules
A repository for code modules that can supplement the Jupyter notebooks.

See the description of [the organization of the Stony Brook database and how it is used by this ECHO_modules repository here](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/ECHO_modules/blob/main/SBU-db.md).

A core goal of EEW is to open up the "black box" of EPA data and its analysis. That's why we've turned to Jupyter Notebooks, which expose both the ECHO database itself as well as the code we use to make sense of the data.

But, the more functionality we add - the more ability we give to users to interact with ECHO in meaningful ways - the more code we have to write. Big blocks of code may dissuade some people from engaging. This was already mentioned in one of Chris's student surveys.

With something like this, we can hide the less meaningful and interactive parts of the code, without, of course, black-boxing everything.
